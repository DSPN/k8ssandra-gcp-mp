=== Deployer ===

Here's what I'm doing currently to build and install the deployer during development.

Create a minimally suitable dev cluster on gke:
gcloud container clusters create --machine-type e2-standard-2 mallen-1

Install the application crd so cluster will understand the Application resource type:
kubectl apply -f "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/marketplace-k8s-app-tools/master/crd/app-crd.yaml"

export REGISTRY=gcr.io/gke-launcher-dev
export APP_NAME=k8ssandra-mp

docker build --tag $REGISTRY/$APP_NAME/deployer .
docker push $REGISTRY/$APP_NAME/deployer

create new namespace to run in:
kubectl create namespace mallen

mpdev install --deployer=$REGISTRY/$APP_NAME/deployer --parameters='{"name": "k8ssandra-mp-1", "namespace": "mallen"}'

The above step fails due to what appears to be a (helm.sh/hook) bug in deployer base image.
see the logs with kubectl logs <pod_name> -n mallen.  NOTE: I worked around this
issue by using a modified `create_manifests.sh` file (see Dockerfile)

Next issue is that I'm getting a permission denied error:

Error from server (Forbidden): error when retrieving current configuration of.

This one should hopefully be easier to resolve, as it seems like it has
something to do with the service account.
